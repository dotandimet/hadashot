Very early-stage and utterly unusable attempt at starting to write Yet Another RSS-Reader thingie in Perl using Mojolicious and Mango
(Mongodb).

If you think the name sucks (it's Hebrew for "news"), you should see the code... or maybe better not.

Implemented:
- Parse and import feeds from OPML file into mongodb.
- fetch subscriptions via command line and save items in mongodb.

Plan:

- Import data from these types of files:
  - OPML (list of feeds, categories)
  - Google Reader exports (OPML, JSON-dump of saved, starred and shared items)
  - Firefox bookmarks file (more RSS feeds, bookmarks)
- Fetch RSS subscriptions, parse RSS/Atom/Whatever and convert to JSON
- Save items for display (JSON in Mongo)
- Query feeds, Query stored items.
- Save (star, bookmark) items.
- Expire items to save space? Why?
- Save and query bookmarks.
- Extract links from RSS (direct link to blog article beats saving the body of
  the article from the feed - full feeds are tl;dr)
- Categorize (tag) feeds, items, bookmarks.
- Auto-tagging?
- Reblogging, Blog publishing.
